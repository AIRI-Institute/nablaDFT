    long_description="""Methods of computational quantum chemistry provide accurate approximations of molecular 
    properties crucial for computer-aided drug discovery and other areas of chemical science. However, 
    high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are 
    a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. 
    This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$ DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains 
    twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, 
    and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and 
    overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level (Ï‰B97X-D/def2-SVP) 
    for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$ DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a 
    substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular 
    property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks.""",
