# Efficient and Equivariant Graph Networks for Predicting Quantum Hamiltonian (QHNet)

The code for training QHNet model.
Code adapted from [repo](https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenDFT/QHNet)

For the training, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
python run.py --config-name qhnet.yaml 
```
